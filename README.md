Pattern libraries are a unique tool that can be used by developers to reuse certain components which can greatly increase productivity.

The aim of this project was investigate how to create a pattern library and from that, creating one myself. The scope of the project said the library
should contain at least six elements (Navigation Bar, Header element, Buttons, Jumbotron, Footer and a Responsive Image Grid).
